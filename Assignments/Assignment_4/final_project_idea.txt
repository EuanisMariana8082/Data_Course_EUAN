#Biol 3100 Assignment 4  “final_project_idea.txt”





In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project


why do platypus glow under UV? I  learned that platypus glow in UV becuase of biofluorences. I would have to look at the wavelength and the intensity of the uv to see when the platypus starts glowing.



Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like


I would have to look for research articles to look at the wavelengths done on the platypus.I will also have to take a look at the wavelength and the intensity. 





(If you already have data, skip this task) Create fake data that simulates what your final project data set might look like. Preferrably a csv file

Using the data of wavelength and the intensity of the UV used on the platypus.





Generate a plot (using ggplot) using either your real or fake data that shows at least one expected result


# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming 'data' is your data frame and it has columns 'wavelength' and 'intensity'
ggplot(data, aes(x=wavelength, y=intensity)) +
  geom_point()  # Creates a scatter plot
