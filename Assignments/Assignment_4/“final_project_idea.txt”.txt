#Biol 3100 Assignment 4  “final_project_idea.txt”


In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project

I want to do research on cancer genomics looking specifically at the clinical trials.
I want to start looking at the clinical trials done on people who have cancer. 


Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like


I will have to take a look at the clinical trials, what medication was used and how much it helped, and what was the outcome. I can look at the name of the project, the type of disease,the sequence,and the primary site of the genome. 




(If you already have data, skip this task) Create fake data that simulates what your final project data set might look like. Preferrably a csv file


In the data file it shows the data of the name, size, and mutations.


The code used:

# Load library
library(ggplot2)

# columns to plot
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Name, y=Mutations))

# layer for points and color
p <- p + geom_point(color = "tan")

# title on plot
p <- p + ggtitle("Cancer Genomics Names and Number of Mutations")
# Rotate x-axis text
p <- p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.9, hjust=1))

# print the plot
print(p)
