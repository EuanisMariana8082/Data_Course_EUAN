# Data Analysis Course - Utah Valley University

This site serves as a repository for all class material.

The course [*website*](https://gzahn.github.io/data-course/) gives a tentative outline of the weekly topics to be covered. It also has assignments and plentiful links to outside resources to help you learn.

*All assignments will be turned in on Canvas as well as your personal GitHub repository.*

You only need to clone this repository to your computer once. After cloning it, copy the Data/ Code_Examples/ Exercises/ and Readings/ directories into **your own** Data_Course_LASTNAME/ directory and then delete this whole repository. This will help avoid common mistakes that students make, confusing the two directories (mine..this one, and yours...Data_Course_LASTNAME)
